ChatGPT is all over my feed. Its a chatbot that can have conversations with you like a human. I asked it to explain JavaScript closures and it explained with code examples. Then asked it to simplify and it rewrote everything simpler. You can also ask it to write functions or help debug code. It doesnt know anything that happened after September 2021 though, and sometimes it sounds confident even when its wrong. Interesting tool!
