2021 was an interesting year for frontend. React 18 beta came out which looks pretty good with features like automatic batching. Next.js 12 moved to Rust compiler and builds are noticeably faster now.

CSS variables are basically everywhere. Tailwind continues to be popular even though some people still dont like utility classes.

The tooling keeps improving. Vite is getting more adoption because its really fast. Testing with React Testing Library feels like the standard now.

Looking forward to 2022. Theres a lot of interesting stuff happening in the modern web.
