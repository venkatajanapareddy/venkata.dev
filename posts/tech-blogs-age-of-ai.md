Is blogging even relevant in the world of AI? People have been reading tech blogs to learn stuff but now you get all the info by chatting with an AI.

It's fast, efficient and saves time. You can ask questions and get answers immediately instead of searching through articles.

## The problem with AI answers

You gotta make sure to double check what AI tells you. It's not always right. Sometimes it gives you code that looks correct but doesnt actually work.

But you can say the same thing about blogs. How can you say a blog is right? It's the authors opinion. They might be wrong or the article might be outdated.

Both sources need verification. You cant just trust everything you read whether its from AI or a blog post.

## The cutoff date advantage

One thing is the cutoff date for ChatGPT is not current. The AI only knows information up to a certain date when it was trained.

So you can still write articles about new tech that launches recently that ChatGPT has no idea about. If a new version of React came out last week the AI wont know about it.

This means blogs are still useful for covering new releases and updates. Someone needs to document these things.

## Summary

Tech blogs still have a place. AI is great for quick answers but it has a knowledge cutoff. Blogs can cover recent developments that AI doesnt know about yet.

Both AI and blogs can be wrong so you need to verify information either way. Use whichever makes sense for what your trying to learn.
